bits 16
;
; Real Mode
;
; The bootloader is a 16 bit environment, as the x86 processor boots us
; into real mode.
;
; Real mode is limited to 1MB (64k) of memory. There is no virtual memory
; or memory protection.
;
; This mode uses the native segment:offset memory model.
;

;
; Registers for Real Mode (16 bit)
;
; CS
; DS
; ES
; SS
;

org 0x7C00

;
; Absolute (Exact) Memory Address = (Segment Address * 16(decimal)) + Offset
; 
; We use '* 16' because we are in real mode which is 16 bit.
;
; Example: 07C0:0000 	< 07C0 is the segment, and 0 is the offset.
;
; Converting the above to the absolute address (0x7C00) by using the formula:
;
; base address = base address * segment size (16) + offset
;
; Example:
; 07C0:0000 = 07C0 * 16 (decimal) + 0
;			= 07C00 + 0 = 0x7C00
;
;
; Different segment:offset pairs yield the same absolute address,
; because they both refer to the same memory location.
;

;
; x86 registers:
;
; CS (Code Segment) - Stores the base segment address for code
; DS (Data Segment) - Stores the base segment address for data
; ES (Extra Segment) - Stores the base segment address for anything
; SS (Stack Segment) - Stores the base segment address for the stack
;

;
; 5 different processor modes
; 
; Protected Mode
;
; - 32 bit processor mode, allows 32 bit registers and access of up to
;   4 gigabytes of RAM.
;
; - No interrupts available, you will need to write them yourself.
;   The use of any interrupt - hardware/software will cause a Triple Fault
;
; - Slightest mistake can cause Triple Fault.
;
; - Requires the use of Descriptor Tables, such as the (GDT, LDT and IDT)
;   (Global Descriptor Table, Local Discriptor Table, Interrupt Discriptor Table)
;
; - Gives access to 4 gigabytes of memory, with memory protection.
;
; - Segment:Offset Addressing is used along with Linear Addressing
;
; - Access and use of 32-bit registers.
;
; Unreal Mode
;
; - Real Mode with the address space (4 gigabyte limit) of Protected Mode.
;
; Virtual 8086 Mode
;
; - Mode that represents Protected Mode with a 16-bit Real Mode emulated
;   environment. BIOS interrupts are only available in Real Mode. This mode
;   provides a way of executing BIOS interrupts from within Protected Mode.

;
; Cylinder
;
; A cylinder is a group of tracks (with the same radius) on the disk.
;
; - Each track is usually divided into 512 byte sectors.
;   On floppies, there are 18 sectors per track.
;
; - A cylinder is a group of tracks with the same radius 
;
; - Floppy disks have two heads
;
; - There are 2880 sectors in total;
;

;
; Floppy Disk
;
; 512 bytes per sector, 18 sectors per track, 80 tracks per side
;
; CL parameter can be from 0 - 17 (because there are only 18 sectors per track)
;
; If the value is greater than 18, the floppy controller
; generates an exception, because the sector does not exist.
;
; Because there is no handler for the exception, the CPU will
; generate a second fault exception, which leads to a Triple Fault. (hard system reboot)
;
; Some floppy disks have two heads/sides. Head 0 is on the front side,
; where sector 0 is located. Because of this, start reading from Head 0.
;
; If the DH parameter is greater than 2, the floppy controller will
; generate an exception, because the head does not exist.
; 
; Because there is no handler for the exception, the CPU will generate
; a second fault exception, which leads to a Triple Fault. (hard system reboot)
;

;
; Drive Number 0 usually represents a floppy drive.
; Drive Number 1 usually represents a 5-1/4" floppy drive.
; Drive Number 7 usually represents a hard disk drive.
;

; Support LFS

; Pad the rest of the file with zeros through to byte 510.

;
; Boot sector
;
; Run by BIOS Interrupt 19h (INT), checking for boot signature (0xAA55)
;
; 0xAA55 makes sure that the file is a valid bootsector, as byte 511-512 are 0xAA 0x55
;
; If found, executes the bootloader at 0x7C00 memory location.
;
; Can either be 'dw 0xAA55' or 'db 0x55AA'

# Contribution
If you would like to take part in helping create this OS, feel free to contribute code to this open source project!

The current list of things to do is:

- Use a small 32-bit kernel to load the filesystem and main OS.
- Boot into the main 32/64 bit kernel.
- Work on filesystem (LFS, custom filesystem)
- Switch the processor into Long (64-bit) mode if it's supported.
- Begin work on Shell and commands
- Work on Optimization
- Start adding GUIs
- Create functional programs
